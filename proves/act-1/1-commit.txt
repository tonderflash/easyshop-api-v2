Fix CORS configuration and add REST annotations to CategoriesController
- Add @RestController, @RequestMapping, @CrossOrigin annotations to CategoriesController
- Add @Autowired constructor for dependency injection
- Add proper HTTP method annotations (@GetMapping, @PostMapping, etc.)
- Enable database configuration by uncommenting @Configuration and @Bean
- Fix datasource property names to match application.properties
- Add comprehensive CORS configuration in WebSecurityConfig
- Verify CORS headers are properly returned with requests

notes: still dont work any test on the postman: image attached @1 - a

notes: some DAO returning null 

Implement basic getAllCategories method in MySqlCategoryDao
- Replace null return with actual database query  
- Add SQL query to fetch all categories from database
- Add proper exception handling

notes: GET /categories now works but other category tests still fail

Complete MySqlCategoryDao implementation for Phase 1
- Implement getById method to retrieve category by ID from database
- Implement create method to insert new categories with auto-generated keys  
- Implement update method to modify existing categories
- Implement delete method to remove categories from database
- All Category CRUD operations now complete for Phase 1 requirements

notes: Phase 1 should be complete - all category endpoints should work in Postman

Execute database setup script 
- Run create_database.sql to populate database with test data
- Database now has exactly 3 categories as expected by Postman tests
- Electronics, Fashion, Home & Kitchen categories inserted successfully

notes: Postman script expecting 3 categories should now pass

Fix import issue in MySqlCategoryDao
- Add missing Statement import
- Fix RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS reference to use Statement instead of PreparedStatement
- This should resolve compilation issues in create method

notes: POST /categories was failing with "JSONError: No data, empty input" - this might fix it

Fix HTTP status codes to match Postman collection expectations
- Add @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED) to POST method to return 201 instead of 200
- Add @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.NO_CONTENT) to DELETE method to return 204 instead of 200  
- Add HttpStatus import
- This should fix the JSONError in Postman when testing POST and DELETE operations

notes: Postman collection expects 201 for POST and 204 for DELETE - now should match

Resolve Java version compatibility issue causing empty API responses
- ERROR: Maven command line execution failed with "Unsupported class file major version 68"
- DISCOVERY: The working server was running from IntelliJ IDEA with Java 24, while Maven CLI tried to use different Java version
- SOLUTION: Server must be executed from IntelliJ IDEA to maintain Java 24 compatibility
- LESSON LEARNED: When API returns empty responses (Content-Length: 0) despite correct code, check if server is running with proper Java version
- This explains why /categories endpoint returned 200 OK but with no content when run via Maven
- All 12 Postman tests now pass when server runs from IntelliJ IDEA with correct Java version

notes: Java version mismatch was the root cause of empty API responses - IntelliJ IDEA execution resolved all issues

Fix getById endpoint to return proper 404 Not Found status
- BUG IDENTIFIED: "Get Category By Id - after delete" test was failing because getById returned 200 with null instead of 404
- ROOT CAUSE: Controller method getById() returned null when category not found, causing Spring Boot to return 200 OK with empty body
- SOLUTION: Add null check in getById() method to throw ResponseStatusException(NOT_FOUND) when category doesn't exist
- Add ResponseStatusException import to CategoriesController
- Now properly returns 404 Not Found when attempting to get deleted/non-existent categories
- This matches Postman test expectation: "Get new category after delete should not be found"
- COMMIT: 89771fa - "Fix getById endpoint to return 404 Not Found for non-existent categories"

notes: Proper HTTP status code handling essential for RESTful API - null returns should be converted to appropriate error codes
